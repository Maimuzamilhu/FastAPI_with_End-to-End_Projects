# FastAPI Blog Repository

Welcome to my FastAPI blog repository! In this series, we will dive deep into FastAPI, a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python. This blog will guide you through various projects to master FastAPI and its numerous features.

## What is FastAPI?

FastAPI is a Python framework that simplifies the creation of APIs. With the increasing importance of APIs in the tech industry, big companies like OpenAI, Google, and Meta offer their services through APIs. This approach allows them to provide access to their services without exposing their internal code or systems. Everyone can use these services via APIs.

### API Management Market Growth

According to recent reports, the API management market has been growing since 2022. As of 2024, it is valued at approximately 9 billion USD and is projected to reach 94 billion USD. This trend underscores the importance of learning API development, as it is a skill that will be highly beneficial in the near future. The rise of AI and the increasing popularity of APIs mean you can create your own APIs and even sell them in marketplaces.

## Blog Structure

In this blog, we will start with a brief overview of Python essentials necessary for FastAPI. Then, we'll proceed through several projects that will progressively teach you more advanced concepts.

### Project 1: Basic CRUD Operations

In our first project, we will learn how to:

- **GET**: Retrieve data
- **POST**: Create new data
- **PUT**: Update existing data
- **DELETE**: Remove data

### Project 2: Advanced Features

In the second project, we will cover:

- Classes
- Error Handling

### Project 3: Databases and Authentication

Our third project will focus on:

- Database integration
- ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)
- JWT (JSON Web Token) Authentication
- Routing

### Project 3.5: Database Migration

A smaller project where you will learn:

- Database migration techniques
- Data management strategies

### Project 4: Testing

The fourth project will teach:

- Unit Testing
- Integration Testing

### Project 5: Full Stack Development

In our final project, we will:

- Build a full-stack application
- Learn about Git and GitHub
- Deploy our application
